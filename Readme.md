Problems:
 - Replaying positions vs input. Think platform that didn't move on the original timeline.
 - Too easy / messy to create a lot of clones. There needs to be a cost or limit associated with that.


TODO:
 - On rewind, animations should replay in reverse (currently they replay, but forward)
 - 


Mechanics:
 - Retrieve an item which causes the player to get trapped. Maybe instead of rewind with possetions, you need to move it to a retrievable location before rewinding.
 - Jump on my dead head (and add the soul effect)
 - Item duplication (unless we decide rewind without possestions)






Possible mechanics:

- Self coordination: past self works with current self (e.g. push both buttons at the same time)
  - chain reaction?
- Paradox: if collide with past self, explode (wiping out both entities and anything in the area)
- Sequence: one instance exposes something the other can use
- Platformer: jump
- Consumables to change the speed of clones? maybe shoot to slow down or speed up to adjust already recorded clones
  - Ray gun of sorts
  - Reverse time direction of individual clones
- Door keys or tools. maybe a clone needs to self sacrifice to get the item to the other clone
- Clone degrade? slower, smaller, less health, etc.
- Camera: 1st person? 3rd person? top down?
- Story/ character?

Effects:

- Time travel plays in reverse until you step off the machine, allowing you to choose how far back to go.
  - maybe go back in time while standing in platform, push button to initiate a clone at that time.
  - not possible to clone if there is a clone already at that position
  - alt: start/end record pads
  - could render the past self paths to help coordinate actions

Visuals:

- Time travel plays in reverse
